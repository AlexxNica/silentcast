 * Translating variables from old bash version of temptoanim:
 * anims_from: was defined but actually never used in bash temptoanim
 *
 * otype: "png" if *p_pngs && !(*p_gif || *p_webm || *p_mp4), "gif" if *p_gif, "webm" if *p_webm, "mp4" if *p_mp4 
 *        (I think bash version was run multiple times to get all selected outputs)
 * rm_png: !(*p_pngs)
 * use_pngs: !(*p_anims_from_temp) && (*p_webm || *p_mp4) and was also used to use exising pngs without generating them from temp.mkv
 * gen_pngs: *p_pngs || (!(*p_anims_from_temp) && (*p_webm || *p_mp4))
 * fps: *p_fps
 *
 * cut, total_cut, group, count: These were for reducing the number of pngs and adjusting the rate if user chose to do so due to memory limitation
