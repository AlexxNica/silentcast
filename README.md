silentcast
==========

<!--
BETTER TO VIEW THIS IN A MARKDOWN VIEWER
When viewed in a markdown viewer, you'll get pictures and even animations made with silentcast. If you don't have a markdown viewer, I personally use a Google Chrome Extension:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview/jmchmkecamhbiokiopfpnfgbidieafmd

After installing the Markdown Preview extenstion, you can't use it until you go into 

chrome://extensions/

to checkmark the box under 

Markdown Preview
 for *Allow access to file URLs*

Then, just open this file with Chrome. You'll probably want to make Google Chrome the default for .md files. You can also just drag and drop this file to an empty tab in Chrome.
