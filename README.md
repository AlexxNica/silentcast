silentcast
==========
##View this file in a markdown viewer or editor
When viewing this document in a markdown viewer, you'll get pictures and even animations made with silentcast. If you don't have a markdown viewer, I personally use a Google Chrome Extension:
[Markdown Preview](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview/jmchmkecamhbiokiopfpnfgbidieafmd)
After installing it, you can't use it until you go into `chrome://extensions/` and checkmark the box under **Markdown Preview** for *Allow access to file URLs*. Then, just open this file with Chrome. You'll probably want to make Google Chrome the default for .md files. You can also just drag and drop this file to an empty tab in Chrome.
