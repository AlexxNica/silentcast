silentcast creates a silent video, silentcast/temp.mkv,
and an animated gif, silentcast/anim.gif, recording an
area of the screen.

Usage: silentcast [-hfr rate#]

    -h          display this help and exit
    -f          set recording area to full screen
                (default is active window excluding
		window decorations)
    -r rate#    set frames per second to rate#
                (default is 8 frames per second)

Examples:

Record the active window, excluding window decorations,
at 8 frames per second:

    silentcast

Record the active window, excluding window decorations,
at 4 frames per second:

    silentcast -r4

Record the full screen at 8 frames per second

    silentcast -f

Record the full screen at 4 frames per second

    silentcast -fr4

silentcast runs 2 other bash scripts that are part of the 
same package: genffcom and temptoanim
Look at those help outputs for more information. Even better,
view /usr/share/doc/silentcast/README.md with a markdown
viewer and get an animated gif demo made with silentcast, as
well as a step by step guide and a list of tips.
